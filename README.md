A modern, async-first MongoDB ORM for Python built on top of Pydantic and Motor. Currently in prototype stage.

## üåü Features

### Core Features
- Async-first design with full async/await support
- Type safety and validation with Pydantic
- Automatic schema and index management
- Comprehensive security system (ACL, RBAC, Record Rules)
- Multi-level caching (memory and Redis)
- Audit logging and change tracking

### Development Tools
- CLI tools for schema management
- Testing utilities and fixtures
- Development server
- Documentation generator

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Installation
```bash
pip install earnorm
```

### Define Models
```python
from earnorm import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class User(BaseModel):
    _collection = "users"
    _indexes = [
        {
            "keys": [("email", 1)],
            "unique": True
        }
    ]
    
    username: str
    email: str
    created_at: datetime = datetime.utcnow()

class Product(BaseModel):
    _collection = "products"
    _abstract = False  # Create collection
    
    name: str
    price: float
```

### Schema Management
```bash
# Create/update collections and indexes
earnorm schema upgrade --database mydb

# View schema information
earnorm schema info --database mydb
```

### Security
```python
# Define groups
@groups.define
class UserGroups:
    ADMIN = "admin"
    USER = "user"

# Define model with security
class Order(BaseModel):
    _collection = "orders"
    _acl = {
        "create": ["admin"],
        "read": ["admin", "user"],
        "write": ["admin"],
        "delete": ["admin"]
    }
    _audit = {
        "create": True,
        "write": ["status", "total"]
    }
```
